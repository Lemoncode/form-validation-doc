# Built in validators

Fonk already ships a set of basic validators:

- Required: check if a field is be informed (field is not null, undefined or empty string), this can be applied to fields of type _string_ or _number_.
- Pattern: check if field matches with a given RegEx.
- MinLength: check if a string field has at least a minimum length.
- MaxLength: check if a string field has at least a minimum length.
- Email: check if a string field is a well formed email address.

# More validators

**Fonk** only ships this minimal subset of validators to avoid adding extra weight to the library with other validators that you may not use.

If you are in the need of using / implementing other validators:

- You have a available a list microlibraries that implement a wide set of validators, allowing you to cherry pick the validators that you really
  need avoding extra weight into your application adding validators that you don't need. You can find a list of third partie validators in the
  following [link](TODO).

- You can implement your own custom validator, is quite easy, you can find instructions about how to build your own custom validation in this
  [link](TODO).
